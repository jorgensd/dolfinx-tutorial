# # A known analytical solution
# Author: JÃ¸rgen S. Dokken
#
# Just as for the [Poisson problem](./../chapter1/fundamentals_code), we construct a test problem which makes it easy to determine if the calculations are correct.
#
# Since we know that our first-order time-stepping scheme is exact for linear functions, we create a problem which has linear variation in time. We combine this with a quadratic variation in space. Therefore, we choose the analytical solution to be
# \begin{align}
# u = 1 + x^2+\alpha y^2 + \beta t
# \end{align}
# which yields a function whose computed values at the degrees of freedom will be exact, regardless of the mesh size and $\Delta t$ as long as the mesh is uniformly partitioned.
# By inserting this into our original PDE, we find that the right hand side $f=\beta-2-2\alpha$. The boundary value $u_d(x,y,t)=1+x^2+\alpha y^2 + \beta t$ and the initial value $u_0(x,y)=1+x^2+\alpha y^2$.
#
# We start by defining the temporal discretization parameters, along with the parameters for $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

# ## Defining the boundary condition
# As in the previous chapters, we define a Dirichlet boundary condition over the whole boundary

# ## Defining the variational formualation
# As we have set $t=0$ in `u_exact`, we can reuse this variable to obtain $u_n$ for the first time step.

u_n = fem.Function(V)
u_n.interpolate(u_exact)

# As $f$ is a constant independent of $t$, we can define it as a constant.

# We can now create our variational formulation, with the bilinear form `a` and  linear form `L`.

L = fem.form(ufl.rhs(F))

# ## Create the matrix and vector for the linear problem
# To ensure that we are solving the variational problem efficiently, we will create several structures which can reuse data, such as matrix sparisty patterns. Especially note as the bilinear form `a` is independent of time, we only need to assemble the matrix once.

A = assemble_matrix(a, bcs=[bc])
A.assemble()
b = create_vector(L)
uh = fem.Function(V)

# ## Define a linear variational solver
# We will use [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) to solve the resulting linear algebra problem. We use the Python-API `petsc4py` to define the solver. We will use a linear solver.

solver.setOperators(A)
solver.setType(PETSc.KSP.Type.PREONLY)
solver.getPC().setType(PETSc.PC.Type.LU)

# ## Solving the time-dependent problem
# With these structures in place, we create our time-stepping loop.
# In this loop, we first update the Dirichlet boundary condition by interpolating the updated
# expression `u_exact` into `V`. The next step is to re-assemble the vector `b`, with the update `u_n`.
# Then, we need to apply the boundary condition to this vector. We do this by using the lifting operation,
# which applies the boundary condition such that symmetry of the matrix is preserved.
# Then we solve the problem using PETSc and update `u_n` with the data from `uh`.

    # Update Diriclet boundary condition

    # Update the right hand side reusing the initial vector
    with b.localForm() as loc_b:
        loc_b.set(0)

    uh.x.scatter_forward()

    # Update solution at previous time step (u_n)
    u_n.x.array[:] = uh.x.array

# ## Verifying the numerical solution
# As in the first chapter, we compute the L2-error and the error at the mesh vertices for the last time step.
# to verify our implementation.
