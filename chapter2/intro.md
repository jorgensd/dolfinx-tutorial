# A Gallery of finite element solvers

The goal of this chapter is to demonstrate how a range of important PDEs from science and  engineering can be quickly solved with a few lines of DOLFINx code. 
We will start with the heat equation, then continue with the nonlinear Poisson equation, the equations for linear elasticity, hyperelasticity, the Navier-Stokes equations and the Helmholtz equations.
These problems illustrate how to solve time-dependent problems, nonlinear problems, vector-valued problems and systems of PDEs.
For each problem, we derive the variational formulation and express the problem in Python in a way that closely resembles the mathematics.
