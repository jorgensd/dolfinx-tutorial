    "# Test problem 1: Channel flow (Poiseuille flow)\n",
    "\n",
    "Authors: Anders Logg and Hans Petter Langtangen\n",
    "\n",
    "Adapted to DOLFINx by: Jørgen S. Dokken\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will learn how to:\n",
    "- Solve the Navier-Stokes problem using a splitting scheme\n",
    "- Visualize functions from higher order Lagrangian spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will compute the flow bewteen two infinite plates, so-called channel or Poiseuille flow.\n",
    "As we shall see, this problem has an analytical solution. \n",
    "Let $H$ be the distance between the plates and  $L$ the length of the channel. There are no body forces. \n",
    "\n",
    "We may scale the problem first to get rid of seemingly independent physical parameters. The physics of this problem is governed by viscous effects only, in the direction perpendicular to the flow, so a time scale should be based on diffusion accross the channel: $t_v=H^2/\\nu$. We let $U$, some characteristic inflow velocity, be the velocity scale and $H$ the spatial scale. The pressure scale is taken as the characteristic shear stress, $\\mu U/H$, since this is a primary example of shear flow. Inserting $\\bar{x}=x/H, \\bar{y}=y/H, \\bar{z}=z/H, \\bar{u}=u/U, \\bar{p}=Hp/{\\mu U}$, and $\\bar{t}=H^2/\\nu$ in the equations results in the scaled Navier-Stokes equations (dropping the bars after scaling)\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: ns-scaled\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}+ \\mathrm{Re} u \\cdot \\nabla u &= -\\nabla p + \\nabla^2 u,\\\\\n",
    "\\nabla \\cdot u &=0.\n",
    "```\n",
    "A detailed derivation for scaling of the Navier-Stokes equation for a large variety of physical situations can be found in {cite}`Langtangen2016scaling` (Chapter 4.2) by Hans Petter Langtangen and Geir K. Pedersen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\mathrm{Re}=\\rho UH/\\mu$ is the Reynolds number. Because of the time and pressure scales, which are different from convection dominated fluid flow, the Reynolds number is associated with the convective term and not the viscity term.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact solution is derived by assuming $u=(u_x(x,y,z),0,0)$ with the $x$-axis pointing along the channel. Since $\\nabla \\cdot u = 0$, $u$ cannot be dependent on $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The physics of channel flow is also two-dimensional so we can omit the $z$-coordinate (more precisely: $\\partial/\\partial z = 0$). Inserting $u=(u_x, 0, 0)$ in the (scaled) governing equations gives $u_x''(y)=\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x)}$.\n",
    "Differentiating this equation with respect to $x$ shows that \n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial^2p}{\\partial^2x}=0$ so $\\partial p/\\partial x$ s a constant here called $-\\beta$. This is the driving force of the flow and can be specified as a known parameter in the problem. Integrating $u_x''(x)=-\\beta$ over the width of the channel, $[0,1]$, and requiring $u=(0,0,0)$ at the channel walls, results in $u_x=\\frac{1}{2}\\beta y(1-y)$. The characteristic inlet velocity $U$ can be taken as the maximum inflow at $y=0.5$, implying $\\beta=8$. The length of the  channel, $L/H$ in the scaled model, has no impact on the result, so for simplicity we just compute on the unit square. Mathematically, the pressure must be prescribed at a point, but since $p$ does not depend on $y$, we can set $p$ to a known value, e.g. zero, along the outlet boundary $x=1$. The result is\n",
    "$p(x)=8(1-x)$ and $u_x=4y(1-y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boundary conditions can be set as $p=8$ at $x=0$, $p=0$ at $x=1$ and $u=(0,0,0)$ on the walls $y=0.1$. This defines the pressure drop and should result in unit maximum velocity at the inlet and outlet and a parabolic velocity profile without no further specifications. Note that it is only meaningful to solve the Navier-Stokes equations i n 2D or 3D geometries, although the underlying mathematical problem collapses to two $1D$ problems, one for $u_x(y)$ and one for $p(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scaled model is not so easy to simulate using a standard Navier-Stokes solver with dimensions. However, one can argue that the convection term is zero, so the Re coefficient in front of this term in the scaled PDEs is not important and can be set to unity. In that case, setting $\\rho=\\mu=1$ in the original Navier-Stokes equations resembles the scaled model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a specific engineering problem one wants to simulate a specific fluid and set corresponding parameters. A general solver is therefore most naturally implemented with dimensions and using the original physical parameters. \n",
    "However, scaling may greatly simplify numerical simulations.\n",
    "First of all, it shows that all fluids behave in the  same way; it does not matter whether we have oil, gas, or water flowing betwen two plates, and it does not matter how fast the flow is (up to some critical value of the Reynolds number where the flow becomes unstable and transitions  to a complicated turbulent flow of totally differnent nature.)\n",
    " This means that one simulation is enough to cover all types of channel flow!\n",
    "In other applications, scaling shows that it might be necessary to just set the fraction of some parameters (dimensionless numbers) rather than the parameters themselves. This simplifies exploring the input parameter space which is often the purpose of simulation. Frequently, the scaled problem is run by setting some of the input parameters with dimension to fixed values (often unity)."

    "## Verification\n",
    "As for the previous problems we compute the error at each degree of freedom and the $L^2(\\Omega)$-error. We start with the  initial condition $u=(0,0)$. We have not specified the initial condition explicitly, and FEniCSx will initialize all `Function`s including `u_n` and `u_` to zero. Since the exact solution is quadratic, we expect to reach machine precision within finite time. For our implementation, we observe that the error quickly approaches zero, and is of order $10^{-6}$ at $T=10\n",

    "## Visualization of higher order functions\n",
    "As the velocity field $u$ is a second order Lagrangian space, it's degrees of freedom does not align with the mesh vertices.\n",
    "To be able to visualize this, we use the convenience function `dolfinx.plot.create_vtk_topology`. However, we will send in the function-space of the velocity field."
