# # Implementation

# Author: JÃ¸rgen S. Dokken
#
# ## Test problem
# To solve a test problem, we need to choose the right hand side $f$, the coefficient $q(u)$, and the boundary $u_D$.
# Previously, we have worked with manufactured solutions that can  be reproduced without approximation errors.
# This is more difficult in nonlinear problems, and the algebra is more tedious.
# However, we will utilize the UFL differentiation capabilities to obtain a manufactured solution.
#
# For this problem, we will choose $q(u) = 1 + u^2$ and define a two dimensional manufactured solution
# that is linear in $x$ and $y$:

def q(u):
    return 1 + u**2


domain = mesh.create_unit_square(MPI.COMM_WORLD, 10, 10)
x = ufl.SpatialCoordinate(domain)
u_ufl = 1 + x[0] + 2 * x[1]
f = -ufl.div(q(u_ufl) * ufl.grad(u_ufl))
# -

# Note that since `x` is a 2D vector, the first component (index 0) represents $x$,
# while the second component (index 1) represents $y$.
# The resulting function `f` can be directly used in variational formulations in DOLFINx.
#
# As we now have defined our source term and an exact solution,
# we can create the appropriate function space and boundary conditions.
# Note that as we have already defined the exact solution,
# we only have to convert it to a Python function that can be evaluated in the interpolation function.
# We do this by employing the Python `eval` and `lambda`-functions.

V = fem.functionspace(domain, ("Lagrange", 1))


def u_exact(x):
    return eval(str(u_ufl))


u_D = fem.Function(V)
u_D.interpolate(u_exact)
fdim = domain.topology.dim - 1
boundary_facets = mesh.locate_entities_boundary(
    domain, fdim, lambda x: numpy.full(x.shape[1], True, dtype=bool)
)
bc = fem.dirichletbc(u_D, fem.locate_dofs_topological(V, fdim, boundary_facets))

# We are now ready to define the variational formulation.
# Note that as the problem is nonlinear, we have to replace the `TrialFunction` with a `Function`,
# which serves as the unknown of our problem.

uh = fem.Function(V)
v = ufl.TestFunction(V)
F = q(uh) * ufl.dot(ufl.grad(uh), ufl.grad(v)) * ufl.dx - f * v * ufl.dx

# ## Newton's method
# The next step is to define the non-linear problem.
# As it is non-linear we will use [Newtons method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method).
# For details about how to implement a Newton solver, see [Custom Newton solvers](../chapter4/newton-solver.ipynb).
# Newton's method requires methods for evaluating the residual `F` (including application of boundary conditions),
# as well as a method for computing the Jacobian matrix.
# DOLFINx provides the function `NonlinearProblem` that implements these methods.
# In addition to the boundary conditions, you can supply the variational form for the Jacobian
# (computed if not supplied), and form and JIT parameters,
# see the [JIT parameters section](../chapter4/compiler_parameters.ipynb).
# The DOLFINx `NonlinearProblem` is an interface to the [PETSc SNES solver](https://petsc.org/release/manual/snes/),
# which provides a large variety of options.
# In this example, we will turn of line-search, to run the problem with a standard Newton method.
# We can also provide PETSc options for the underlying linear solver (KSP) and preconditioner (PC).

# ```{admonition} Convergence checks
# We can remove the assertion above, and let PETSc do the error handling by adding
# `snes_error_if_not_converged: True` to the `petsc_options` dictionary.
# This will raise an exception if the solver does not converge.
# We can also set the `snes_atol` and `snes_rtol` or `snes_stol` to control the convergence criteria
# or create custom convergence checks, see [SNES: Convergence checks](https://petsc.org/main/manual/snes/#convergence-tests)
# for more details.
# ```


# We observe that the solver converges after $8$ iterations.
# If we think of the problem in terms of finite differences on a uniform mesh,
# $\mathcal{P}_1$ elements mimic standard second-order finite differences,
# which compute the derivative of a linear or quadratic funtion exactly.
# Here $\nabla u$ is a constant vector, which is multiplied by $1+u^2$,
# giving a second order polynomial in $x$ and $y$, which the finite difference operator would compute exactly.
# We can therefore, even with $\mathcal{P}_1$ elements, expect the manufactured solution to be
# reproduced by the numerical method.
# However, if we had chosen a nonlinearity, such as $1+u^4$, this would not be the case,
# and we would need to verify convergence rates.
