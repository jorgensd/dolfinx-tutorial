    "- How to create a spatially varying Dirichlet boundary conditions on the whole domain boundary\n",
    "- How to define a weak formulation of your PDE\n",
    "- How to solve the resulting system of linear equations\n",

    "the equation to obtain the right-hand side (source term $f$).\n",
    "Then solve the equation with this right hand side, and using the exact solution as boundary condition.\n",

    "$10^{-5}$ on a $20 \\times 20$ grid.\n",
    "However, since we are using Sobolev spaces, we usually know about the numerical errors _asymptotic properties_.\n",
    "For instance that it is proportional to $h^2$ if $h$ is the size of a cell in the mesh.\n",
    "We can then compare the error on meshes with different $h$-values to see if the asymptotic behavior is correct.\n",
    "This technique will be explained in detail in the chapter [Improving your fenics code](./../chapter4/convergence).\n",
