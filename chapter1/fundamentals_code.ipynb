We have used the notation `ufl.dot(ufl.grad(u), ufl.grad(v))*ufl.dx`. The dot product in UFL computes the sum (contraction) over the last index of the first factor and first index of the second factor. In this case, both factors are tensors of rank one (vectors) and so the sum is just over the single index of both $\\nabla u$ and $\\nabla v$. To compute an inner product of matrices (with two indices), one must instead of `ufl.dot` use the function `ufl.inner`. For vectors, `ufl.dot` and `ufl.inner` are equivalent.\n",
