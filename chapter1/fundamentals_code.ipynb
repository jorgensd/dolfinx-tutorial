    "- How to use the built-in meshes in DOLFINx\n",
    "- How to create a spatially varying Dirichlet boundary conditions on the whole domain boundary\n",
    "- How to define a weak formulation of your PDE\n",

    "The Poisson problem has so far featured a general domain $\\Omega$ and general functions $u_D$ for the boundary conditions and $f$ for the right hand side.\n",
    "Therefore, we need to make specific choices of $\\Omega, u_D$ and $f$. A wise choice is to construct a problem  with a known analytical solution, so that we can check that the computed solution is correct. The primary candidates are lower-order polynomials. The continuous Galerkin finite element spaces of degree $r$ will exactly reproduce polynomials of degree $r$. \n",
    "<!-- Particularly, piecewise linear continuous Galerkin finite elements are able to exactly reproduce a quadratic polynomial on \n",

    "\n",
    "This simple but very powerful method for constructing test problems is called _the method of manufactured solutions_. \n",
    "First pick a simple expression for the exact solution, plug into\n",
    "the equation to obtain the right-hand side (source term $f$). Then solve the equation with this right hand side, and using the exact solution as boundary condition. Finally, we create a program that tries to reproduce the exact solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in many cases, it can be hard to determine if the program works if it produces an error of size $10^{-5}$ on a\n",
    "$20 \\times 20$ grid. However, since we are using Sobolev spaces,\n",
    "we usually know about the numerical errors _asymptotic properties_. For instance that it is proportional to $h^2$ if $h$ is the size of a cell in the mesh. We can then compare the error on meshes with different $h$-values to see if the asymptotic behavior is correct. This technique will be explained in detail in the chapter [Improving your fenics code](./../chapter4/convergence).\n",

    "However, in cases where we have a solution we know that should have no approximation error, we know that the solution should\n",
