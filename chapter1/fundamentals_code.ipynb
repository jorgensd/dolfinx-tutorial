    "In this section, you will learn:\n",
    "- How to use the built-in meshes in DOLFINx\n",
    "- How to create a spatially varying Dirichlet boundary conditions on the whole domain boundary\n",
    "- How to define a weak formulation of your PDE\n",
    "- How to solve the resulting system of linear equations\n",
    "- How to visualize the solution using a variety of tools\n",

    "This simple but very powerful method for constructing test problems is called _the method of manufactured solutions_.\n",
    "First pick a simple expression for the exact solution, plug into\n",
    "the equation to obtain the right-hand side (source term $f$).\n",
    "Then solve the equation with this right hand side, and using the exact solution as boundary condition.\n",
    "Finally, we create a program that tries to reproduce the exact solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in many cases, it can be hard to determine if the program works if it produces an error of size\n",
    "$10^{-5}$ on a $20 \\times 20$ grid.\n",
    "However, since we are using Sobolev spaces, we usually know about the numerical errors _asymptotic properties_.\n",
    "For instance that it is proportional to $h^2$ if $h$ is the size of a cell in the mesh.\n",
    "We can then compare the error on meshes with different $h$-values to see if the asymptotic behavior is correct.\n",
    "This technique will be explained in detail in the chapter [Improving your fenics code](./../chapter4/convergence).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in cases where we have a solution we know that should have no approximation error,\n",
