# # Implementation
# Author: JÃ¸rgen S. Dokken
#
# In this section, we will solve the deflection of the membrane problem.
# After finishing this section, you should be able to:
# - Create a simple mesh using the GMSH Python API and load it into DOLFINx
# - Create constant boundary conditions using a geometrical identifier
# - Use `ufl.SpatialCoordinate` to create a spatially varying function
# - Interpolate a `ufl.Expression` into an appropriate function space
# - Evaluate a `dolfinx.Function` at any point $x$
# - Use Paraview to visualize the solution of a PDE
#
# ## Creating the mesh
#
# To create the computational geometry, we use the Python-API of [GMSH](https://gmsh.info/). We start by importing the gmsh-module and initializing it.

import gmsh

gmsh.initialize()

# The next step is to create the membrane and start the computations by the GMSH CAD kernel, to generate the relevant underlying data structures. The first arguments of `addDisk` are the x, y and z coordinate of the center of the circle, while the two last arguments are the x-radius and y-radius.

membrane = gmsh.model.occ.addDisk(0, 0, 0, 1, 1)
gmsh.model.occ.synchronize()

# After that, we make the membrane a physical surface, such that it is recognized by `gmsh` when generating the mesh. As a surface is a two-dimensional entity, we add `2` as the first argument, the entity tag of the membrane as the second argument, and the physical tag as the last argument. In a later demo, we will get into when this tag matters.

gdim = 2
gmsh.model.addPhysicalGroup(gdim, [membrane], 1)

# Finally, we generate the two-dimensional mesh. We set a uniform mesh size by modifying the GMSH options.

gmsh.option.setNumber("Mesh.CharacteristicLengthMin", 0.05)
gmsh.option.setNumber("Mesh.CharacteristicLengthMax", 0.05)
gmsh.model.mesh.generate(gdim)

# # Interfacing with GMSH in DOLFINx
# We will import the GMSH-mesh directly from GMSH into DOLFINx via the `dolfinx.io.gmshio` interface.
# The `gmshio` module contains two functions
# 1. `gmshio.model_to_mesh` which takes in a `gmsh.model` and returns a `dolfinx.io.gmshio.MeshData` object.
# 2. `gmshio.read_from_msh` which takes in a path to a `.msh`-file and returns a `dolfinx.io.gmshio.MeshData` object.
#
# The `MeshData` object will contain a `dolfinx.mesh.Mesh`, under the attribute `mesh`.
# This mesh will contain all GMSH Physical Groups of the highest topolgoical dimension.
# ```{note}
# If you do not use `gmsh.model.addPhysicalGroup` when creating the mesh with GMSH, it can not be read into DOLFINx.
# ```
# The `MeshData` object can also contain tags for all other `PhysicalGroups` that has been added to the mesh, that being `vertex_tags`, `edge_tags`, `facet_tags` and `cell_tags`.
# To read either `gmsh.model` or a `.msh`-file, one has to distribute the mesh to all processes used by DOLFINx.
# As GMSH does not support mesh creation with MPI, we currently have a `gmsh.model.mesh` on each process.
# To distribute the mesh, we have to specify which process the mesh was created on, and which communicator rank should distribute the mesh.
# The `model_to_mesh` will then load the mesh on the specified rank, and distribute it to the communicator using a mesh partitioner.

domain = mesh_data.mesh

# We define the function space as in the previous tutorial

from dolfinx import fem

V = fem.functionspace(domain, ("Lagrange", 1))

# ## Defining a spatially varying load
# The right hand side pressure function is represented using `ufl.SpatialCoordinate` and two constants, one for $\beta$ and one for $R_0$.

import ufl
from dolfinx import default_scalar_type

x = ufl.SpatialCoordinate(domain)
beta = fem.Constant(domain, default_scalar_type(12))
R0 = fem.Constant(domain, default_scalar_type(0.3))
p = 4 * ufl.exp(-(beta**2) * (x[0] ** 2 + (x[1] - R0) ** 2))

# ## Create a Dirichlet boundary condition using geometrical conditions
# The next step is to create the homogeneous boundary condition. As opposed to the [first tutorial](./fundamentals_code.ipynb) we will use `dolfinx.fem.locate_dofs_geometrical` to locate the degrees of freedom on the boundary. As we know that our domain is a circle with radius 1, we know that any degree of freedom should be located at a coordinate $(x,y)$ such that $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=1$.

import numpy as np


def on_boundary(x):
    return np.isclose(np.sqrt(x[0] ** 2 + x[1] ** 2), 1)


boundary_dofs = fem.locate_dofs_geometrical(V, on_boundary)
# -

# As our Dirichlet condition is homogeneous (`u=0` on the whole boundary), we can initialize the `dolfinx.fem.dirichletbc` with a constant value, the degrees of freedom and the function space to apply the boundary condition on.

bc = fem.dirichletbc(default_scalar_type(0), boundary_dofs, V)

# ## Defining the variational problem
# The variational problem is the same as in our first Poisson problem, where `f` is replaced by `p`.

u = ufl.TrialFunction(V)
v = ufl.TestFunction(V)
a = ufl.dot(ufl.grad(u), ufl.grad(v)) * ufl.dx
L = p * v * ufl.dx
problem = LinearProblem(
    a, L, bcs=[bc], petsc_options={"ksp_type": "preonly", "pc_type": "lu"}
)
uh = problem.solve()

# ## Interpolation of a `ufl`-expression
# As we previously defined the load `p` as a spatially varying function, we would like to interpolate this function into an appropriate function space for visualization. To do this we use the `dolfinx.Expression`. The expression takes in any `ufl`-expression, and a set of points on the reference element. We will use the interpolation points of the space we want to interpolate in to.
# We choose a high order function space to represent the function `p`, as it is rapidly varying in space.

Q = fem.functionspace(domain, ("Lagrange", 5))
expr = fem.Expression(p, Q.element.interpolation_points)
pressure = fem.Function(Q)
pressure.interpolate(expr)

# ## Plotting the solution over a line
# We first plot the deflection $u_h$ over the domain $\Omega$.

from dolfinx.plot import vtk_mesh
import pyvista

pyvista.start_xvfb()

# Extract topology from mesh and create pyvista mesh
topology, cell_types, x = vtk_mesh(V)
grid = pyvista.UnstructuredGrid(topology, cell_types, x)

# Set deflection values and add it to plotter
grid.point_data["u"] = uh.x.array
warped = grid.warp_by_scalar("u", factor=25)

plotter = pyvista.Plotter()
plotter.add_mesh(warped, show_edges=True, show_scalar_bar=True, scalars="u")
if not pyvista.OFF_SCREEN:
    plotter.show()
else:
    plotter.screenshot("deflection.png")
# -

# We next plot the load on the domain

load_plotter = pyvista.Plotter()
p_grid = pyvista.UnstructuredGrid(*vtk_mesh(Q))
p_grid.point_data["p"] = pressure.x.array.real
warped_p = p_grid.warp_by_scalar("p", factor=0.5)
warped_p.set_active_scalars("p")
load_plotter.add_mesh(warped_p, show_scalar_bar=True)
load_plotter.view_xy()
if not pyvista.OFF_SCREEN:
    load_plotter.show()
else:
    load_plotter.screenshot("load.png")

# ## Making curve plots throughout the domain
# Another way to compare the deflection and the load is to make a plot along the line $x=0$.
# This is just a matter of defining a set of points along the $y$-axis and evaluating the finite element functions $u$ and $p$ at these points.

tol = 0.001  # Avoid hitting the outside of the domain
y = np.linspace(-1 + tol, 1 - tol, 101)
points = np.zeros((3, 101))
points[1] = y
u_values = []
p_values = []

# As a finite element function is the linear combination of all degrees of freedom, $u_h(x)=\sum_{i=1}^N c_i \phi_i(x)$ where $c_i$ are the coefficients of $u_h$ and $\phi_i$ is the $i$-th basis function, we can compute the exact solution at any point in $\Omega$.
# However, as a mesh consists of a large set of degrees of freedom (i.e. $N$ is large), we want to reduce the number of evaluations of the basis function $\phi_i(x)$. We do this by identifying which cell of the mesh $x$ is in.
# This is efficiently done by creating a bounding box tree of the cells of the mesh, allowing a quick recursive search through the mesh entities.

from dolfinx import geometry

bb_tree = geometry.bb_tree(domain, domain.topology.dim)

# Now we can compute which cells the bounding box tree collides with using `dolfinx.geometry.compute_collisions_points`. This function returns a list of cells whose bounding box collide for each input point. As different points might have different number of cells, the data is stored in `dolfinx.cpp.graph.AdjacencyList_int32`, where one can access the cells for the `i`th point by calling `links(i)`.
# However, as the bounding box of a cell spans more of $\mathbb{R}^n$ than the actual cell, we check that the actual cell collides with the input point
# using `dolfinx.geometry.select_colliding_cells`, which measures the exact distance between the point and the cell (approximated as a convex hull for higher order geometries).
# This function also returns an adjacency-list, as the point might align with a facet, edge or vertex that is shared between multiple cells in the mesh.
#
# Finally, we would like the code below to run in parallel, when the mesh is distributed over multiple processors. In that case, it is not guaranteed that every point in `points` is on each processor. Therefore we create a subset `points_on_proc` only containing the points found on the current processor.

cells = []
points_on_proc = []
# Find cells whose bounding-box collide with the the points
cell_candidates = geometry.compute_collisions_points(bb_tree, points.T)
# Choose one of the cells that contains the point
colliding_cells = geometry.compute_colliding_cells(domain, cell_candidates, points.T)
for i, point in enumerate(points.T):
    if len(colliding_cells.links(i)) > 0:
        points_on_proc.append(point)
        cells.append(colliding_cells.links(i)[0])

# We now have a list of points on the processor, on in which cell each point belongs. We can then call `uh.eval` and `pressure.eval` to obtain the set of values for all the points.
#

points_on_proc = np.array(points_on_proc, dtype=np.float64)
u_values = uh.eval(points_on_proc, cells)
p_values = pressure.eval(points_on_proc, cells)

# As we now have an array of coordinates and two arrays of function values, we can use `matplotlib` to plot them

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig = plt.figure()
plt.plot(
    points_on_proc[:, 1],
    50 * u_values,
    "k",
    linewidth=2,
    label="Deflection ($\\times 50$)",
)
plt.plot(points_on_proc[:, 1], p_values, "b--", linewidth=2, label="Load")
plt.grid(True)
plt.xlabel("y")
plt.legend()
# If run in parallel as a python file, we save a plot per processor
plt.savefig(f"membrane_rank{MPI.COMM_WORLD.rank:d}.png")

# ## Saving functions to file
# As mentioned in the previous section, we can also use Paraview to visualize the solution.
