# # JIT options and visualization using Pandas
# Author: JÃ¸rgen S. Dokken
#
# In this chapter, we will explore how to optimize and inspect the integration kernels used in DOLFINx.
# As we have seen in the previous demos, DOLFINx uses the [Unified form language](https://github.com/FEniCS/ufl/) to describe variational problems.
#
# These descriptions have to be translated into code for assembling the right and left hand side of the discrete variational problem.
#
# DOLFINx uses [ffcx](https://github.com/FEniCS/ffcx/) to generate efficient C code assembling the element matrices.
# This C code is in turn compiled using [CFFI](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and we can specify a variety of compile options.
#
# We start by specifying the current directory as the location to place the generated C files, we obtain the current directory using pathlib

import pandas as pd

from mpi4py import MPI
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Dict

cache_dir = f"{str(Path.cwd())}/.cache"
print(f"Directory to put C files in: {cache_dir}")

# Next we generate a general function to assemble the mass matrix for a unit cube. Note that we use `dolfinx.fem.form` to compile the variational form. For codes using `dolfinx.fem.petsc.LinearProblem`, you can supply `jit_options` as a keyword argument.

    V = functionspace(mesh, (space, degree))
    u = TrialFunction(V)
    v = TestFunction(V)
    a = inner(u, v) * dx

# We start by considering the different levels of optimization that the C compiler can use on the optimized code. A list of optimization options and explanations can be found [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html)

optimization_options = ["-O1", "-O2", "-O3", "-Ofast"]

# The next option we can choose is if we want to compile the code with `-march=native` or not. This option enables instructions for the local machine, and can give different results on different systems. More information can be found [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/AArch64-Options.html#g_t-march-and--mcpu-Feature-Modifiers)

march_native = [True, False]

# We choose a subset of finite element spaces, varying the order of the space to look at the effects it has on the assembly time with different compile options.

results = {"Space": [], "Degree": [], "Options": [], "Time": []}
for space in ["N1curl", "Lagrange", "RT"]:
    for degree in [1, 2, 3]:
        for native in march_native:
            for option in optimization_options:
                if native:
                    cffi_options = [option, "-march=native"]
                else:
                    cffi_options = [option]
                jit_options = {"cffi_extra_compile_args": cffi_options,
                               "cache_dir": cache_dir, "cffi_libraries": ["m"]}
                runtime = compile_form(space, degree, jit_options=jit_options)
                results["Space"].append(space)
                results["Degree"].append(str(degree))
                results["Options"].append("\n".join(cffi_options))
                results["Time"].append(runtime)

# We have now stored all the results to a dictionary. To visualize it, we use pandas and its Dataframe class. We can inspect the data in a jupyter notebook as follows

results_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(results)
results_df

# We can now make a plot for each element type to see the variation given the different compile options. We create a new colum for each element type and degree.

seaborn.set(style="ticks")
seaborn.set(font_scale=1.2)
seaborn.set_style("darkgrid")
results_df["Element"] = results_df["Space"] + " " + results_df["Degree"]
elements = sorted(set(results_df["Element"]))
for element in elements:
    df_e = results_df[results_df["Element"] == element]
    g = seaborn.catplot(x="Options", y="Time", kind="bar", data=df_e, col="Element")
    g.fig.set_size_inches(16, 4)

# We observe that the compile time increases when increasing the degree of the function space, and that we get most speedup by using "-O3" or "-Ofast" combined with "-march=native".
