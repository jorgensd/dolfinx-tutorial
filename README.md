If you have any comments, corrections or questions, please submit an issue in the issue tracker.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this tutorial, please make a fork of the repository, make your changes, and test that the CI passes. You can do this locally by downloading [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) and call

```bash
act -j test-nightly
```

Alternatively, if you want to add a separate chapter, a Jupyter notebook can be added to a pull request, without integrating it into the tutorial. If so, the notebook will be reviewed and modified to be included in the tutorial.

Any code added to the tutorial should work in parallel. If any changes are made to `ipynb` files, please ensure that these changes are reflected in the corresponding `py` files by using [`jupytext`](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#can-i-use-jupytext-with-jupyterhub-binder-nteract-colab-saturn-or-azure):

```bash
python3 -m jupytext --sync  */*.ipynb --set-formats ipynb,py:light
```
or
```bash
python3 -m jupytext --sync  */*.py --set-formats ipynb,py:light
```

Any code added to the tutorial should work in parallel.

To strip notebook output, one can use pre-commit.

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Dependencies

It is adviced to use a pre-installed version of DOLFINx, for instance through conda or docker. Remaining dependencies can be installed with

```bash
python3 -m pip install --no-binary=h5py -e .
```
