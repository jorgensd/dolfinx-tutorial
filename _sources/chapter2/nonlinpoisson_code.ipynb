    "To solve a test problem, we need to choose the right hand side $f$ and the coefficient $q(u)$ and the boundary $u_D$. Previously, we have worked with manufactured solutions that can  be reproduced without approximation errors. This is more difficult in non-linear porblems, and the algebra is more tedious. Howeve, we will utilize UFLs differentiation capabilities to obtain a manufactured solution. \n",
